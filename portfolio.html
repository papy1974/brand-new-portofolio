                                                    The app is for people interested in learning new languages. Built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, Sequelize, Chart.js, Passport, and Bootstrap, users can create accounts and embark on their language learning journey.

                                                        jQuery to get the language code from the selected option on the dropdown & translation in text box
                                                        User types out what they want to translate
                                                        Button is disabled until the text field has non-space characters.Step 2:
                                                        User clicks submit
                                                        Style of the button changes to processing to indicate to the user that a transaction is in progress
